# Group Project, Milestone 1: Design Journey

[← Table of Contents](design-journey.md)


## Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts are normal and to be expected. It's best to develop a plan for handling conflicts before they arise.

**This contract is a _living_ document.** If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

Your team contract should probably include these elements. Feel free to remove or add other terms, too.

1. To what goals do we all commit?


    We commit to communicating internal deadlines for the project milestones, deciding which times and dates we should meet on a weekly basis, completing our assigned tasks, and timely communication.


2. What are our "ground rules"? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)

    **Tip:** Interrupting another person can make them feel like their option isn't valued. Consider a rule about interrupting.

    Our ground rules are to meet the deadlines, notify if we can’t meet the deadlines, and be generally respectful of each other’s opinions. We will also give everyone space to talk and contribute their opinions. We will also commit each of our work on GitHub.

3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

    We will communicate daily through text messages and weekly on Zoom to assign tasks. We will meet once a week for assigning tasks and meet again to check our submission together. We will also meet again if additional issues arise.

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

    We will communicate with our client through the GitHub client communication discussion forum. We will meet as a team before letting one person reach out to the client.

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**No "coder" or "designer" roles are permitted;** everyone must design and code.)

    **Tip:** It's often helpful to think of **responsibilities** rather than roles here.

    We will create 3 submission roles for three different people (one for each milestone), and 2 communication roles for communicating with our client for the last 2 milestones. We will also create a role for internal deadlines reminders.

6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

    We’ll hold ourselves accountable through team meetings, internal deadlines, and text message reminders of internal deadlines. We will ask the person who isn’t contributing equally if there are other thighs in their life that are impacting their group work. We will find accommodations to account for personal life events and adjust accordingly. If we are not able to find a solution after trying hard, we will go to the TAs or professor Harms for help with the situation.


7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

    We will give each other the opportunity to state our opinions and perspectives and then take a vote. We will use the majority opinion to approach the conflict.

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

    We will re-visit this contract before we start working on each milestone, and make sure every group member can access it and contribute. We will also re-visit it if there is conflict that arises.

9. What else do we want to include in this contract? Maybe you team needs a _fun_ clause...

    **Tip:** Not everything in life is about work. Sometimes it is important to celebrate too. Consider grabbing a coffee or ice cream at the completion of your project to celebrate!

    We will get to know each other better by meeting in person during lab and outside of class. We could grab a snack together to celebrate the submission of each milestone.


## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your conflict using the contract, please email the instructors at <info1300@cornell.edu>. Please be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before an instructor will intervene.


## Audience
> Briefly explain your site's audience.

Our site’s audience is College of Engineering students that are working towards a B.S. in Information Science Systems and Technology.

> Explain how this audience is the least represented in your group. (1-2 sentences)

The least represented in our group would be Engineering IS majors. This is because our group has 3 people from A&S, 1 person from CALS, and 1 person from CHE. Therefore, Engineering IS majors are the least represented in our group.


## User Interview Planning
> Plan the user interview which you'll use to identify the goals of your site's audience.

**User Interview Briefing and discuss and document here& Consent:** Hi, I am a student at Cornell University. I'm currently taking a class on web design and for a project, I am re-designing the website for Information Science majors. I'm trying to learn more about the people that might use this site. May I ask you a few questions? It will take about 10 minutes. You are free to quit at any time.

1. Think about a time you tried to find your major requirements. How did you go about doing so?
2. Recall if you have ever visited the Bowers CIS page for the Information Science, Systems, and Technology major offered to students in the College of Engineering (linked [here](https://cis.cornell.edu/undergraduate-opportunities/ISST))? Describe this experience: For what purpose did you visit the page? How did you find this page, and was it easy or difficult to do so?
3. Remember a recent time when you needed to balance your major and college requirements while making class enrollment decisions. Please describe this experience.
4. How do you check or confirm if you are on the right track to meet your major requirements? What resources do you use or how do you go about doing so?
5. Recall a recent time you needed to reach out to an advisor in the department. How did you go about finding their contact information?


**After the interview:** This was really helpful. Thank you so much for agreeing to speak with me today. Have a great day!


## Interview Notes
> **Each team member** should interview at least 3 people from your audience.
> Take notes and include those notes here. Make sure to include a brief description of each interviewee.
> **Copy the interview questions above into each interviewee section below.**
> Take notes for each participant inline with the questions. You should have about 1 sentence in notes for each question.

**Aarush**
**Interviewee 1:**

My interviewee is an ISST major.

**1. Think about a time you tried to find your major requirements. How did you go about doing so?** Visited the CIS website and engineering handbook.

**2. Recall if you have ever visited the Bowers CIS page for the Information Science, Systems, and Technology major offered to students in the College of Engineering (linked [here](https://cis.cornell.edu/undergraduate-opportunities/ISST))? Describe this experience: For what purpose did you visit the page? How did you find this page, and was it easy or difficult to do so?** Yes. I typed cornell isst on google and the CIS website shows up. I've used it to see what classes fulfill my concentration requirements. It was easy to do so.

**3. Remember a recent time when you needed to balance your major and college requirements while making class enrollment decisions. Please describe this experience.** There are too many engineering college requirements so I always prioritize those first because the major requirements are flexible in terms of which classes can fulfill which requirements.

**4. How do you check or confirm if you are on the right track to meet your major requirements? What resources do you use or how do you go about doing so?** I refer to the isst major checklist to see which classes I have taken and which are left.

**5. Recall a recent time you needed to reach out to an advisor in the department. How did you go about finding their contact information?** This is always difficult. I would have to google what type of advisor I want to speak to and then there is a lot of navigation I have to do to find their booking link.

**Interviewee 2:**

Since the ISST majors did not respond to emails, my interviewee is an Info. Sci. Arts & Sciences major. While not a part of our primary audience, they serve as a good proxy audience because they also have to interface with the current Bower CIS web design to access similar requirements and advisors. Since they have the same goals, they serve as a good proxy (because ISST majors are few and far in between).

**1. Think about a time you tried to find your major requirements. How did you go about doing so?** I went to the CIS website.

**2. Recall if you have ever visited the Bowers CIS page for the Information Science major offered to students in the College of Arts and Sciences (linked [here](https://infosci.cornell.edu/undergraduate/info-sci-majors/ba-information-science-college-arts-sciences))? Describe this experience: For what purpose did you visit the page? How did you find this page, and was it easy or difficult to do so?** I visited the site to learn about the major requirements and concentrations I can choose from. It was relatively straightforward to find this page and it was easy to comprehend.

**3. Remember a recent time when you needed to balance your major and college requirements while making class enrollment decisions. Please describe this experience.** I needed to decide what Info Sci classes I would take this spring since many of them are only offered during the fall. I had to do more research and eventually decided to take classes that fulfilled the other requirements of Info Sci, such as a Stats class, instead of taking an Info Sci class that was potentially competitive to get into.

**4. How do you check or confirm if you are on the right track to meet your major requirements? What resources do you use or how do you go about doing so?** I haven't really used any resources to keep track of my progress, but I regularly go to the A&S distribution page to check what classes I should take.

**5. Recall a recent time you needed to reach out to an advisor in the department. How did you go about finding their contact information?** My advising dean sent out an email after my A&S advising seminar that had her contact info. I used that to contact her for questions I had for courses. (This is referring to their experience with the Arts advising team, which is not really what the question was asking, so this answer should not be factored into goals.)

**Interviewee 3:**

As a student of Arts & Sciences, while not a part of our primary audience, this interviewee serves as a good proxy audience because they also had to interface with the current Bower CIS web design to access similar requirements and advisors. Since they have the same goals as the ISST majors, they serve as a good proxy (because ISST majors are few and far in between).

**1. Think about a time you tried to find your major requirements. How did you go about doing so?** I actually visited the requirements through the Arts & Sciences website, which was difficult process since those pages are not easy to navigate. I looked at the Bowers page once I discovered through my talks with my advisor that the information on the Arts pages might be incomplete or not updated.

**2. Recall if you have ever visited the Bowers CIS page for the Information Science major offered to students in the College of Arts and Sciences (linked [here](https://infosci.cornell.edu/undergraduate/info-sci-majors/ba-information-science-college-arts-sciences))? Describe this experience: For what purpose did you visit the page? How did you find this page, and was it easy or difficult to do so?** I visited this site to find out about more specific requirements for the major (such as the requirement of taking a stats course here; you can't use AP credit). I found the nagivation a bit cumbersome, because there's so many different pages that all have a portion of what you need to know; it wasn't well-aggregated into one page that I could look at for everything, and I had to do a lot more reading and clicking than felt necessary or easy. I don't recall exactly how I found the page; I probably just googled it or was given the link by an advisor.

**3. Remember a recent time when you needed to balance your major and college requirements while making class enrollment decisions. Please describe this experience.** I don't think I've ever had to do this; I switched to Info in my second semester, and during that semester I was primarily taking college requirement classes. And then this semester, I've been taking primarily Info classes. I don't think that I've ever had more of a balanced semester.

**4. How do you check or confirm if you are on the right track to meet your major requirements? What resources do you use or how do you go about doing so?** Arts has a special page (I think it's called DUST) where you can check the college requirements. Otherwise, I keep a Google Doc where I organize all the classes I need to take and check them off as I complete them. This doc is always up on my laptop.

**5. Recall a recent time you needed to reach out to an advisor in the department. How did you go about finding their contact information?** My Arts advising dean has always been easy to reach; since they reached out to me over the summer before my first semester, I've always had their contact. The Info advisors have been more difficult. I think I stumbled across their offices at Rhodes and then, because they were only doing Zoom appointments that day, I looked that information up to attend their virtual office hours and email them my questions. Actually, the only time I really chatted with them abotu my major requirements was in-person during an event at Gates.


**Tran**
**Interviewee 4:**

My interviewee is a senior majoring in Information Science, Systems, and Technology in the College of Engineering. Her primary concentration is Data Science.

**1. Think about a time you tried to find your major requirements. How did you go about doing so?** I went on the CIS Bowers webpage for ISST.

**2. Recall if you have ever visited the Bowers CIS page for the Information Science, Systems, and Technology major offered to students in the College of Engineering (linked [here](https://cis.cornell.edu/undergraduate-opportunities/ISST))? Describe this experience: For what purpose did you visit the page? How did you find this page, and was it easy or difficult to do so?** Of course I have. I visited the page to mainly check my major requirements. It was honestly pretty easy because everything was broken down by college, and the concentration, etc. I use the page listing the concentration requirements for Data Science the most.

**3. Remember a recent time when you needed to balance your major and college requirements while making class enrollment decisions. Please describe this experience.** The website definitely helped because it accurately outlines all of my requirements. It's true that I have to switch among around 5 pages - Core Requirements, Math Requirements, Data Science Concentration, Major Approved Electives, and the College Requirements. However, they are all sources that I can trust, as opposed to just word of mouth.

**4. How do you check or confirm if you are on the right track to meet your major requirements? What resources do you use or how do you go about doing so?** I use the student checklist that all ISST-affiliated students are given upon affiliation. I also schedule appointments with my advisor 1-2 times a semester.

**5. Recall a recent time you needed to reach out to an advisor in the department. How did you go about finding their contact information?** My advisors send regular email updates about their OHs and the major, so their scheduler link is always included, and that is what I use to contact them and set up a meeting.


**Interviewee 5:**

My interviewee is a sophomore majoring in Information Science, Systems, and Technology in the College of Engineering. Her concentrations are Data Science & UX/UI.

**1. Think about a time you tried to find your major requirements. How did you go about doing so?** Engineering has handbooks. In each handbook, they have different requirements listed  for different majors, and I think the requirements for each year are different, too. They list all the classes I have to take. However, they do not list concentration or liberal studies courses so I then have to go on the website. I also think that concentration classes are not up to date.

**2. Recall if you have ever visited the Bowers CIS page for the Information Science, Systems, and Technology major offered to students in the College of Engineering (linked [here](https://cis.cornell.edu/undergraduate-opportunities/ISST))? Describe this experience: For what purpose did you visit the page? How did you find this page, and was it easy or difficult to do so?** It was easy. I just searched them on Google, and then the page just showed different concentrations. I just clicked on the concentration I am in. It did not take much time for me to find the requirements.

**3. Remember a recent time when you needed to balance your major and college requirements while making class enrollment decisions. Please describe this experience.** The website made it quite challenging because the classes were not up to date. It also only listed the course code, title but it did not show the course is offered in fall or spring and in more useful details. Therefore, I had to go through a list of every class for the description, professor, time, etc. The same problem applied to college requirements, so I had to go to the roster to search for more details for both major and college requirements.

**4. How do you check or confirm if you are on the right track to meet your major requirements? What resources do you use or how do you go about doing so?** I use the Engineering handbook. All Engineering majors have a flowchart.For every class I have taken, I will cross them out. The handbook also says I should not take below this certain amount of credit or else I will not graduate in time.

**5. Recall a recent time you needed to reach out to an advisor in the department. How did you go about finding their contact information?** I actually recently scheduled an appointment with an advisor. It took me some time to find the email, so if it stands out it will be better. I also just went to the pre-enroll dinner with WICC last week and the Head of CIS she told me about the advising email and it turned out it was also the same email.


**Interviewee 6:**

My interviewee is a sophomore majoring in Information Science, Systems, and Technology in the College of Engineering. His concentrations are Interactive Technologies & Data Science.

**1. Think about a time you tried to find your major requirements. How did you go about doing so?** I went to the Cornell ISST website from the Bowers CIS. I clicked core requirements, concentration suggestions so then I could choose which ones fit my schedule and align with my major requirements.

**2. Recall if you have ever visited the Bowers CIS page for the Information Science, Systems, and Technology major offered to students in the College of Engineering (linked [here](https://cis.cornell.edu/undergraduate-opportunities/ISST))? Describe this experience: For what purpose did you visit the page? How did you find this page, and was it easy or difficult to do so?** Yes. I visited it to check if there are any courses that can help with my major requirements and my potential career track. I just found out about this page because Engineering has a website for each major. It was easy to find it, I just clicked through a few pages, found the ISST page among the section for Engineering majors and then I found it.

**3. Remember a recent time when you needed to balance your major and college requirements while making class enrollment decisions. Please describe this experience.** It helped on the part that they suggested the courses to fulfill the concentrations. However, it didn’t give information about semester, time, and how the class itself could potentially fulfill both college and major requirements through cross listing. I had to figure that out myself by browsing through the roster.

**4. How do you check or confirm if you are on the right track to meet your major requirements? What resources do you use or how do you go about doing so?** I use the Cornell Engineering handbook and I also contact my advisors. Also go to the website to check sometimes, but most of the time the handbook is sufficient for me because it is more up-to-date.

**5. Recall a recent time you needed to reach out to an advisor in the department. How did you go about finding their contact information?** For faculty advisors, I went to the CIS Research page for ISST because I believe every faculty member could help me with advising and figuring out my interests, including opportunities and career-related stuff. For general advisors, I just looked up online and used the alphabetical last name that each advisor is assigned to and contacted them. For example, my last name started with N so I knew that Sahri Chery is my advisor. Her email was on the website, too, and there was a link to schedule an appointment.

**Adelyn**

**Interviewee 7:**

She is a junior studying ISST in Engineering, and her concentrations are Data Science and UX.

**1. Think about a time you tried to find your major requirements. How did you go about doing so?** I usually go to the ISST tab on the information science website and go through the major requirements for majors entering after 2022. I also go to the engineering handbook to get a better idea of when courses should be offered and when they recommend we take them.

**2. Recall if you have ever visited the Bowers CIS page for the Information Science, Systems, and Technology major offered to students in the College of Engineering (linked [here](https://cis.cornell.edu/undergraduate-opportunities/ISST))? Describe this experience: For what purpose did you visit the page? How did you find this page, and was it easy or difficult to do so?** I first visited the site to determine the major requirements and concentrations available in the major. I found this page by googling ISST and taking the first link available. I think that was a little confusing because it defaulted to the 2020 requirements, which aren't relevant to me. I didnt notice I was on the wrong page for a while, but once I figured it out it was easy to navigate.


**3. Remember a recent time when you needed to balance your major and college requirements while making class enrollment decisions. Please describe this experience.** For this pre-enroll I had to make sure I was meeting requirements for ISST, engineering, and my minor. I spent a lot of time on the ISST page looking at the concentration classes I was missing. It was very helpful to have them all on one page, but having to jump between the bowers page and scheduler to figure out what semesters classes are offered was a little annoying.


**4. How do you check or confirm if you are on the right track to meet your major requirements? What resources do you use or how do you go about doing so?** I usually use the engineering flowchart to determine if I'm on track for engineering requirements. I then have little lists with classes I want to take for each concentration, so I check those off once I finish those. They're also organized on my flowchart based on the semester I hope to take them.

**5. Recall a recent time you needed to reach out to an advisor in the department. How did you go about finding their contact information?** I found my advisor's information on an advising email to all information science majors.


**Interviewee 8:**

She is a junior studying engineering with a concentration in data science. She is passionate about using data analytics to solve complex problems and improve decision-making processes across various fields.

**1. Think about a time you tried to find your major requirements. How did you go about doing so?**I recently looked for my major requirements by visiting the Information Science website. I navigated to the appropriate section for my concentration to review the specific courses and degree requirements listed there.

**2. Recall if you have ever visited the Bowers CIS page for the Information Science, Systems, and Technology major offered to students in the College of Engineering (linked [here](https://cis.cornell.edu/undergraduate-opportunities/ISST))? Describe this experience: For what purpose did you visit the page? How did you find this page, and was it easy or difficult to do so?** Yes, I visited the Bowers CIS page for the Information Science, Systems, and Technology major a few days ago. I went to this page to check the elective courses available for my concentration, ensuring that I selected classes that would complement my data science skills. I found the page easily by searching for "Information Science" on the Cornell CIS website, and it was straightforward to navigate.

**3. Remember a recent time when you needed to balance your major and college requirements while making class enrollment decisions. Please describe this experience.**Recently, I needed to balance my major and college requirements while planning my course schedule. I reviewed the elective options available for my concentration and compared them to the core courses I needed to take. I made sure that my selections would meet both my major requirements and any general education requirements set by the college.

**4. How do you check or confirm if you are on the right track to meet your major requirements? What resources do you use or how do you go about doing so?**To check if I'm on track to meet my major requirements, I regularly consult the Information Science website for updates on course offerings and degree requirements. I also review my academic plan and use the degree audit feature available through the university's student portal to confirm that I'm completing the necessary courses.

**5. Recall a recent time you needed to reach out to an advisor in the department. How did you go about finding their contact information?**I recently needed to reach out to an advisor in my department for guidance on course selection. I found their contact information by visiting the department's website, where they listed faculty and advisor contacts along with their email addresses. It was easy to locate the information, and I was able to send them an email directly.

**Interviewee 9:**

He is an ISST major in engineering college concentrating in Interactive Technologies and UX.

**1. Think about a time you tried to find your major requirements. How did you go about doing so?**I just looked up "info sci cornell requirements" on Google and clicked on the first link.

**2. Recall if you have ever visited the Bowers CIS page for the Information Science, Systems, and Technology major offered to students in the College of Engineering (linked [here](https://cis.cornell.edu/undergraduate-opportunities/ISST))? Describe this experience: For what purpose did you visit the page? How did you find this page, and was it easy or difficult to do so?**I usually visit the page to see what classes I am able to take to fulfill my requirements. Finding the page was pretty simple after Googling "info sci cornell requirements."

**3. Remember a recent time when you needed to balance your major and college requirements while making class enrollment decisions. Please describe this experience.** It was a pretty difficult process because some classes are offered in the Fall but not in the Spring and vice versa. I looked at my degree checklist and wrote down a list of classes offered in the following semester, then for each one, determined whether or not it fulfills a requirement AND if it fits into my schedule.

**4. How do you check or confirm if you are on the right track to meet your major requirements? What resources do you use or how do you go about doing so?** I usually just look at my CIS checklist. If I have any questions, I reach out to my advisor via email.

**5. Recall a recent time you needed to reach out to an advisor in the department. How did you go about finding their contact information?**I knew my advisor's name but looking up her name on Google doesn't really help. However, if I look up "cornell info sci advisors" on Google and click on the first link, it contains everything I need.

**Tanisha**

**Interviewee 10:**

This interviewee was senior ISST major. She is not sure what concentration she wants to do but she is interested in data science and a secondary concentration in behavioral science or UX.

**1. Think about a time you tried to find your major requirements. How did you go about doing so?** She did a google search for ISST at Cornell and found the website. She spent most of the time finding major requirements looking for her concentration requirements. She also uses a spreadsheet to track her requirements and see what she has left to complete.

**2. Recall if you have ever visited the Bowers CIS page for the Information Science, Systems, and Technology major offered to students in the College of Engineering (linked [here](https://cis.cornell.edu/undergraduate-opportunities/ISST))? Describe this experience: For what purpose did you visit the page? How did you find this page, and was it easy or difficult to do so?** She used the website by googling it and found it to be an information overload. She said it took time to find all the requirements, which was the purpose she was using it for.

**3. Remember a recent time when you needed to balance your major and college requirements while making class enrollment decisions. Please describe this experience.** She didn't commit to ISST until her sophomore spring, so she focused on her college requirements more than her major requirements during her first two years.

**4. How do you check or confirm if you are on the right track to meet your major requirements? What resources do you use or how do you go about doing so?** She uses a chart that is sent to ISST majors to track her requirements. She said she uses the checklist chart more than the flowchart at this point.

**5. Recall a recent time you needed to reach out to an advisor in the department. How did you go about finding their contact information?** She reached out to an advisor to fix a class time conflict and she used the appointment booking website rather than finding the individual contacts for the advisors. She said the appointments were full, so she had to go to drop in hours to meet with them.


**Interviewee 11:**

This interviewee was junior ISST major. She plans to concentrate in interactive technologies and UX.

**1. Think about a time you tried to find your major requirements. How did you go about doing so?** She googled the information science requirements and looked at the engineering handbook to find her requirements. She used the handbook to find her engineering requirements and information science core classes, and the website to look at concentration requirements.

**2. Recall if you have ever visited the Bowers CIS page for the Information Science, Systems, and Technology major offered to students in the College of Engineering (linked [here](https://cis.cornell.edu/undergraduate-opportunities/ISST))? Describe this experience: For what purpose did you visit the page? How did you find this page, and was it easy or difficult to do so?** She visited the CIS page for information science during pre enroll to find out what classes she needed to take for her major requirements. She found a link to the page from her engineering handbook and she said it was not too difficult to find.

**3. Remember a recent time when you needed to balance your major and college requirements while making class enrollment decisions. Please describe this experience.** During her freshman and sophomore year, she said she focused on her engineering requirements because she was still deciding between ISST and CS. She then did her core requirements, adding in some concentration requirements if the core ones weren't offered that semester.

**4. How do you check or confirm if you are on the right track to meet your major requirements? What resources do you use or how do you go about doing so?** She uses the ISST checklist that was sent to her from her advisor. She said her advisor updates it every semester, but she mostly keeps track of her major requirements on her own using that checklist. She also consults the engineering flowchart and CIS website to check her progress.

**5. Recall a recent time you needed to reach out to an advisor in the department. How did you go about finding their contact information?** She didn't find the contact for her advisor online. Instead, her advisor reached out to her and she just went back and searched her email in order to find the contact for her advisor. She noted that the contacts were difficult to find.


**Interviewee 12:**

This interviewee was an unaffiliated underclassman engineering student who was interested in ISST.

**1. Think about a time you tried to find your major requirements. How did you go about doing so?** He googled requirements for the different majors he was interested in and clicked on the websites that came up.

**2. Recall if you have ever visited the Bowers CIS page for the Information Science, Systems, and Technology major offered to students in the College of Engineering (linked [here](https://cis.cornell.edu/undergraduate-opportunities/ISST))? Describe this experience: For what purpose did you visit the page? How did you find this page, and was it easy or difficult to do so?** He did visit the CIS website, but he mostly used the engineering flowchart to navigate his first few semesters. He visited the page to find major requirements, and said it wasn't hard to find, but it had many pages on it.

**3. Remember a recent time when you needed to balance your major and college requirements while making class enrollment decisions. Please describe this experience.** He used the flowchart to make enrollment decisions and went to an advisor if he had extra questions.

**4. How do you check or confirm if you are on the right track to meet your major requirements? What resources do you use or how do you go about doing so?** As an underclassman, he said he uses the flowchart to make sure he is on the right track because he said he was looking to first complete most of his engineering core classes in his first two years.

**5. Recall a recent time you needed to reach out to an advisor in the department. How did you go about finding their contact information?** He learned about the advisors during his engineering seminar, which is how he went about finding their contact information.

**John**

**Interviewee 13**
This interviewee was a freshman who's not yet affiliated with ISST major, but is interested in it.

**1. Think about a time you tried to find your major requirements. How did you go about doing so?** He started by searching for "ISST major requirements at Cornell" on Google. The search brought up the College of Engineering and CIS websites, which he clicked through to find detailed requirements.

**2. Recall if you have ever visited the Bowers CIS page for the Information Science, Systems, and Technology major offered to students in the College of Engineering (linked [here](https://cis.cornell.edu/undergraduate-opportunities/ISST))? Describe this experience: For what purpose did you visit the page? How did you find this page, and was it easy or difficult to do so?**
Yes, I checked it out while browsing different majors. I was curious about what the ISST requirements were and whether it would involve a lot of programming or data science. I found it through a Google search by typing “Cornell ISST requirements.” The page was easy to navigate, but I found myself jumping between links to figure out the exact courses I’d need to take, which made it a bit of a hunt for information.

**3. Remember a recent time when you needed to balance your major and college requirements while making class enrollment decisions. Please describe this experience.**
During enrollment, I focused on fulfilling my engineering core requirements first and used the academic flowchart as a guide. I consulted my advisor when I had specific questions about balancing ISST prerequisites with other college requirements, which helped streamline my choices.

**4. How do you check or confirm if you are on the right track to meet your major requirements? What resources do you use or how do you go about doing so?**
I regularly refer to the flowchart to make sure I’m meeting all core requirements and ISST prerequisites, as it helps me visually track what I’ve completed and what’s left. Additionally, I cross-reference my selections with the requirements listed on the CIS website to ensure accuracy.

**5. Recall a recent time you needed to reach out to an advisor in the department. How did you go about finding their contact information?**
I learned about the advisors during an introductory engineering seminar and found their contact information on the engineering department’s website. This was straightforward as the seminar had pointed me to where these resources were listed.

**Interviewee 14**
This interviewee was a freshman who's not yet affiliated with ISST major, but is interested in it.

**1. Think about a time you tried to find your major requirements. How did you go about doing so?** I mainly used Google to search for the ISST major requirements. I found a few pages on Cornell’s CIS website and skimmed through them to get an idea of what courses were involved.

**2. Recall if you have ever visited the Bowers CIS page for the Information Science, Systems, and Technology major offered to students in the College of Engineering (linked [here](https://cis.cornell.edu/undergraduate-opportunities/ISST))? Describe this experience: For what purpose did you visit the page? How did you find this page, and was it easy or difficult to do so?**
Yes, I visit the page whenever I’m planning out classes for next semester to make sure I’m on track with the requirements. Finding it was pretty straightforward—I typed "Cornell ISST major" into Google, and it came right up. The page is laid out logically, so I usually find what I need in a few clicks, even if there’s a lot of info to sift through.

**3. Remember a recent time when you needed to balance your major and college requirements while making class enrollment decisions. Please describe this experience.**
As a freshman, I’m mostly focusing on general requirements right now. I used the first-year advising checklist to make my choices and talked with my peer advisor to make sure I was enrolling in the right core courses.

**4. How do you check or confirm if you are on the right track to meet your major requirements? What resources do you use or how do you go about doing so?**
Right now, I use the engineering flowchart and my peer advisor. I also check the college requirements checklist to make sure I’m hitting the basics for my first year. I’ll probably look more at ISST-specific requirements next year.

**5. Recall a recent time you needed to reach out to an advisor in the department. How did you go about finding their contact information?**
I found out about advisors during orientation week and saved their information from a flyer we got. I haven’t needed to reach out yet but will likely contact them when I start planning out my major requirements more in-depth.

**Interviewee 15**
This interviewee was a  Junior ISST Student Concentrating in Data Science

**1. Think about a time you tried to find your major requirements. How did you go about doing so?** When I recently needed to confirm my major requirements, I explored the Information Science section of the Cornell website. It felt a bit like assembling a map of my path—I focused on the concentration-specific courses for data science, taking note of core classes and electives that would enrich my data skills. It was a productive visit, and I left with a solid outline of what I needed to fulfill.

**2. Recall if you have ever visited the Bowers CIS page for the Information Science, Systems, and Technology major offered to students in the College of Engineering (linked [here](https://cis.cornell.edu/undergraduate-opportunities/ISST))? Describe this experience: For what purpose did you visit the page? How did you find this page, and was it easy or difficult to do so?**
Yes, I've visited the site multiple times. Initially when thinking of what major I wanted to do as a freshman, and then most recently to see what concentration courses/electives I'm allowed to take/the requirements in general for the major. I just googled Cornell ISST and it popped up, finding the course electives was relatively easy.

**3. Remember a recent time when you needed to balance your major and college requirements while making class enrollment decisions. Please describe this experience.**
I had to fit in an engineering elective, my core data science classes, and a broader humanities course. I mapped out each course against my degree checklist and ensured each one supported either my major or general requirements. A couple of last-minute adjustments later, I had a schedule that satisfied my goals and the college's.

**4. How do you check or confirm if you are on the right track to meet your major requirements? What resources do you use or how do you go about doing so?**
To stay on track, I do a regular "audit" of my courses. I visit the Information Science site to keep up with any new class offerings and updates in degree requirements, then double-check my progress in the university's degree audit tool. Having these two resources makes it easy to confirm that I’m right where I need to be academically.

**5. Recall a recent time you needed to reach out to an advisor in the department. How did you go about finding their contact information?**
I recently needed to get in contact with an advisor to ask if opening another discussion time for a course was possible. But instead of going to the CIS website, I emailed the engineering department first who then directed me to a ticket-system to get in contact with the CIS department. Then after about a week I finally got a response. The process was not very straightforward and later on looking at the site it's not clear where to contact them and if the way you're doing so is the correct one for what your purpose of contacting them is.
