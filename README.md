# Overview
This group project was my final assignment for my class INFO 1300: Introductory Design and Programming for the Web. My team and I re-designed and developed a multi-page website with interactive elements for Information Science Systems and Technology majors in the College of Engineering at Cornell University. 

There were 3 milestones in this project: 

# Project Milestones
## Milestone 1: User Research and Planning
- Established team ground rules and authored a team contract.
- Selected the target audience and conducted user interviews to identify their goals.
- Analyzed user research data to define audience goals and created a content plan to meet those needs.

## Milestone 2: Draft Website 
- Studied existing websites for inspiration, focusing on effective use of interactivity to enhance user experience.
- Planned content placement, navigation structure, and brainstormed interactivity ideas.
- Created sketches to explore layout ideas and finalized designs for all pages, including narrow and wide versions.
- Coded the website using a mobile-first approach, starting with the narrow version and later incorporating responsive design for wide screens.

## Final Milestone: Professional Website
- Designed and planned interactivity with detailed sketches and pseudocode. 
- Implemented interactivity using JavaScript.
- Conducted an accessibility audit to identify and fix any accessibility issues.

# My Contributions 
- Participated in brainstorming ideas and drawing sketches for the entire website.
- Designed and coded the "General Requirements" page.
- Provided feedback to teammates on their pages and helped fix their bugs.
- Conducted an accessibility audit.
- Refined HTML, CSS, and JavaScript codes to ensure a consistent structure.
